What's New?

1. A better AR image genenation paradigm and transformer model structure based on 2D autoregression. It generate images of higher quality without increasing computation budget.

2. A spark of vision-language intelligence for the first time, enabling unconditional rich-text image generation, outperforming diffusion models like DDPM and Stable Diffusion on dedicated rich-text image datasets, highlighting the distinct advantage of autoregressive models for multimodal modeling.
